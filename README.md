In the online internet era, the idea of Recommendation technology was initially introduced in the mid-90s. Proposed CRESA that combined visual features, textual attributes and visual attention of the user to build the clothes profile and generate recommendations. Utilized fashion magazines photographs to generate recommendations. Multiple features from the images were extracted to learn the contents like fabric, collar, sleeves, etc., to produce recommendations. In order to meet the diverse needs of different users, an intelligent Fashion recommender system is studied based on the principles of fashion and aesthetics. To generate garment recommendations, customer ratings and clothing were utilized in The history of clothes and accessories, weather conditions were considered in to generate recommendations.
n this project, we propose a model that uses Convolutional Neural Network and the Nearest neighbour backed recommender. As shown in the figure Initially, the neural networks are trained and then an inventory is selected for generating recommendations and a database is created for the items in inventory. The nearest neighbourâ€™s algorithm is used to find the most relevant products based on the input image and recommendations are generated.
